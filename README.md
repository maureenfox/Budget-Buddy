This project was made in XCode as my final project for Professor Gallaugher's IOS Programming in Swift and SwiftUI class at Boston College. 
I am a junior at Boston College studying Business Analytics and Entrepreneurship, so this class really helped me channel my technological experience into 
a creative development in a programming language I've never encountered previously. 

The app's purpose is to track communal purchases made for roommates, specifically in college. The inspiration was drawn from my own room. Oftentimes we would 
share the responsibilities of buying communal items such as TVs, Microwaves, Toilet Paper, etc. for our dorm over the summer and it was hard to keep track of who needs 
to pay who. BudgetBuddy does the trakcing for you. It includes a sign in with a list of items you can add everytime you purchase, along with your Venmo Handle and a 
photo picker for receipts. You can toggle back and forth to check off the purchase once it has been reimbursed.
